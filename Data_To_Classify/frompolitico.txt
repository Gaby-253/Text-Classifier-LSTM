Back in America’s first Gilded Age, in the final days of the 19th century, Republican power broker Mark Hanna harnessed the wealth of the robber barons to the Republican Party to create what he hoped would be an unbeatable political advantage. “There are two things that are important in politics,” he famously said. “The first is money, and I can’t remember what the second one is.” It is in that spirit that we offer our cover package for this campaign season issue of  Politico Magazine: a special report on money, politics and power in the midst of America’s New Gilded Age. For there’s no doubt that the troubling nexus of money and power is a lot of what this year’s elections are about at a time of spiraling inequality, massive, unaccountable political spending and a Washington that increasingly seems dysfunctional by design.
